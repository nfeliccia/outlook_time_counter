ONSITE INTERVIEW: ASTM / Data Quality Analyst ,False,,"Nic, 

 

You are all set for your ONSITE interview with ASTM! Please see details below…

 

 

WHEN:
Monday 12/23 at 12:30pm EST 

 

WHERE:

100 Barr Harbor Dr, Conshohocken, PA 19428

**there is parking in a garage under the building.  Free lot….head up the elevators to the lobby floor and check in at the desk.  Ask for Jarkeer Lasseter upon arrival. 

 

DRESS:

PROFESSIONAL ATTIRE – SUITE/JACKET/TIE

 

WHAT TO EXPECT:

One hour in duration, onsite with the ASTM team.  Jarkeer, and most likely Cory Will from his team (BA in the ops team) will run the interview.  Focus on overall Data Analysis skills, strong SQL --- ANY migration experience in previous projects, and definitely the Reporting aspect of the role (manual, tools, etc)

 

MUST demonstrate hands on skills --- they do not want “philosophy” without backing it with tactical work / samples/ approach to get it done and how. 

 

Thanks Nic! Good luck!
